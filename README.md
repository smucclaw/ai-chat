# AI Chat
A simple AI chat UI to connect to OpenAI v1 compatible API streaming endpoints. 

Supports markdown, code and math highlighting and uses local-storage for chat history.
Supports a few tool calls:
1. Basic web search with Google Custom Search credentials
2. Basic weather lookup from OpenMeteo
3. User chat history inquiries
4. Basic reasoning if you ask it to do research
5. Solving simple math



# Getting started
I can recommend LM Studio to run server APIs. Use a decently capable model as `Chat Model` and a fast, easy to run one as `Summary Model`. The latter enables automatic naming of conversations and the suggestion of follow-up topics.

Hint: In the `index.html` is a max-length of 20,000 characters hardcoded. Adjust to your preferences.
